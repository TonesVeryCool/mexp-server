# mexp-server
MineXplorer server recreation written with Deno

# How to use
- Testing: `deno task dev`
- Prod: `deno task run`

# TODO
- [ ] speak toggle option in config
- [ ] shared ghosts between maps
- [ ] 5 character users only (block users with the first 5 characters being the same but the rest being different)
- [ ] special bans (force hell/force void) (was this ever used outside of `tutwh` anyway?)
- [ ] game downloads (`/version/mexp`)
- [ ] test versions below v35

# Version Compatibility
* `Guaranteed not working`: This version doesn't work with the server recreation.
* `Might work, not confirmed`: Due to similarities with another compatible version, it might work, but it hasn't been tested.
* `Guaranteed working`: This version works with the server recreation.
* `No available build`: A build of this version is not available and as such cannot be tested, although it is most likely not functional. This does **not** mean a build does not exist.
