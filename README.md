# mexp-server
MineXplorer server recreation written with Deno

# How to use
- Testing: `deno task dev`
- Prod: `deno task run`

# TODO
- [x] speak toggle option in config
- [x] shared ghosts between maps
- [x] 5 character users only (block users with the first 5 characters being the same but the rest being different)
- [ ] special bans (force hell/force void) (was this ever used outside of `tutwh` anyway?)
- [x] game downloads (`/version/mexp`)
- [x] test versions below v35
- [ ] find the _editor spawn map (is it even possible?)

# Inaccuracies
- Speak has some inaccuracies with word mixing
- Profile last online dates might not be 100% accurate
- Ghost inactivity/gone times might not be 100% accurate
- Captcha images are not 100% accurate (but it's impossible to make them 1:1 with MineXplorer)
- `map_ballpit_alt` requirements are not 100% accurate
- The map switch timers might be inaccurate
- Captcha expiry times might not be 100% accurate
- The /counter implementation is nowhere close to accurate
- _editor does not spawn in the correct map (see todo above)
